## NLP Text Classification with Hugging Face and TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to perform text classification using Hugging Face’s transformers library with a TensorFlow backend. The model used is TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification, specifically designed for TensorFlow, ensuring compatibility and ease of use. The dataset is tokenized and prepared using Hugging Face’s datasets library, and the training is conducted using TensorFlow.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify text data using a pre-trained BERT model (or any similar model from Hugging Face’s library) fine-tuned on a specific dataset. The model is trained to distinguish between two classes (binary classification).
